Moment generating function is the expected value of $e^{tx}$ with respect to the pdf of the variable. If we differentiate <em>mgf</em> and then let $t=0$, we can get $E(X), E(X^2), \dots$. So <em>mgf</em> is a way to find $\mu$ and $\sigma$ if the pdf itself is complicated. Furthermore, <em>mgf</em> can also be used to prove the similarity of two pdfs, if and only if their <em>mgf</em> are the same.
