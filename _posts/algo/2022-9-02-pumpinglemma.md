Pumping lemma is a theorem that states that all regular languages have a special property:
all strings in the language can be “pumped” if they are at least as long as a certain special
value, called the pumping length.

Pumping lemma is saying **Regular Language must have 3 properties**. We can use its contrapositive to prove
if a language is **not regular**. However, pumping lemma CANNOT be used to prove a language is **regular**.
